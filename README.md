# Hi there, I'm SuperDev 👋🏾

## 👩🏾‍💻 About Me

I’m a Software Engineer driven by a passion for building inclusive technologies, making open-source contribution more accessible, and fostering vibrant developer communities. My technical interests lie at the intersection of modern front-end development and developer experience, with a focus on React.js, the Jamstack architecture (JavaScript, APIs & Markup), and GraphQL.

In 2020, I had the honor of being named an inaugural GitHub Star 🌟, a recognition awarded to developers who make significant contributions to the open-source ecosystem and actively uplift the tech community through mentorship, education, and collaboration.

My enthusiasm for the React ecosystem inspired me to create React Robins, a supportive community dedicated to empowering women and non-binary React developers through peer learning and shared growth. I believe in the power of technology as a force for social good and strive to create spaces and tools that lower barriers and invite participation.
